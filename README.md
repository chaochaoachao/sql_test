# sql_test

This interview assessment requires using of SQLite to load db file(which is not uploaded) 
And make data analysis according to 3 tables in the db file.

My approach:

Using SQLite in the python jupyter notebook.

Solving the problems with both sqlite and pandas modules. 

Make visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.
